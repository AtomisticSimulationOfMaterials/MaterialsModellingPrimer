## Introduction
To support the Modelling Primer session we have provided a set of simple modelling exercises that introduce some key concepts common to much materials modelling practice. We will illustrate these concepts using classical molecular dynamics simulations. All of these simulations will be run via Google's Colab platform

If you haven't already got a google account, please sign up for one now.

## Setting up Google colab

The first step is to navigate to the [github repository for the session](https://github.com/AtomisticSimulationOfMaterials/MaterialsModellingPrimer)

You should see something like in @fig-repo.

Make sure you are viewing `ReadMe.md` and right-click the badge circled in the figure and select `open in new tab`. This will open a Colab tab and you should then see something like @fig-colab_open.

Select `XX-CombinedExercises.ipynb`. You'll be asked a couple of questions. Confirm you want to proceed you'll then see the notebook in Colab as in @fig-colab1

If you click the file icon as shown in @fig-colab1 this will open your folder structure and you should see something like @fig-colab2.

The next step is to run the two code cells in this notebook. Click on the first code cell and then hit `shift + return`. You'll be asked to sign in to your Google account as in @fig-colab_signin.

Of the various permissions, you should only need to select those permissions that are obviously relevant to accessing your files on Google drive. You may need to hit the refresh button in the sidebar (@fig-colab3) but you should then see that `drive` now appears.

Execute the second code cell in the notebook (by clicking on it then hitting `shift + return`). This will clone the repository of files for the exercises into your Google drive. You should now be able to find all the files for the session under `drive/MyDrive` as in @fig-colab4 (my Google drive also has a lot of clutter in it).

Run the next three code cells (see @fig-colab5). These cells:

* Install the lammps molecular dynamics software (and a module that will help us read the output)
* Load the python modules that we will need for the exercises
* Define a function we will us a lot in the exercises.

## The exercises

All that ermains now is to work through the exercises in the rest of the notebook. I'll let you know the right point in the lecture to run each exercise.

Note that the exercises will be run in the folders:

* `02-BulkModulus/`
* `03-VacancyFormation/`
* `04-GrainBoundary/`
* `04-GrainBoundary/`
* `05-UnrelaxedInterstitial/`

You can ignore the notebooks in these folders (they reproduce the contents of the current notebook, `XX-CombinedExercises.ipynb`, but for one exercise at a time).
